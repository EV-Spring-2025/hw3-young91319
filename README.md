### Observation:

Lowering grid_v_damping_scale reduced oscillations, while increasing it caused more visible shaking. For other parameters (softening, substeps, n_grid), visual differences were minimal in the output videos. Notably, increasing substeps too much caused the simulation to crash, likely due to numerical instability.

# EV-HW3: PhysGaussian

This homework is based on the recent CVPR 2024 paper [PhysGaussian](https://github.com/XPandora/PhysGaussian/tree/main), which introduces a novel framework that integrates physical constraints into 3D Gaussian representations for modeling generative dynamics.

You are **not required** to implement training from scratch. Instead, your task is to set up the environment as specified in the official repository and run the simulation scripts to observe and analyze the results.


## Getting the Code from the Official PhysGaussian GitHub Repository
Download the official codebase using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/XPandora/PhysGaussian.git
```


## Environment Setup
Navigate to the "PhysGaussian" directory and follow the instructions under the "Python Environment" section in the official README to set up the environment.


## Running the Simulation
Follow the "Quick Start" section and execute the simulation scripts as instructed. Make sure to verify your outputs and understand the role of physics constraints in the generated dynamics.


## Homework Instructions
Please complete Part 1â€“2 as described in the [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13JcQC12pI8Wb9ZuaVV400HVZr9eUeZvf7gB7Le8FRV4/edit?usp=sharing).
